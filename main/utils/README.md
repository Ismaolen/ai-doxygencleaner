## Overview
The `utils` directory is part of the `ai_doxygen_cleaner` project. 
The `utils.py` script within this directory contains utility 
functions to handle miscellaneous tasks, such as compiling 
warning details, performing file differences, 
and generating HTML from a diff file.

The `utils.py` script contains three primary functions:

- `compaine_warn_details()`
- `perform_diff_on_files()`
- `generate_html_diff()`

## `compaine_warn_details(warning_content_llist, warning_line_number_llist, file_content_list, header_file_name_list)`
This function takes in four lists: warning content, warning line numbers, 
file content, and header file names. It compiles 
these details into a list of prompts that contain 
warnings and their respective file contents. 

Example usage:
```python
prompts = compaine_warn_details(warning_content_llist, 
                                warning_line_number_llist, file_content_list, 
                                header_file_name_list)
```

## `perform_diff_on_files() -> None`
This function uses the `diff` command to compare two 
files and outputs the difference to a text file. 
It specifically compares `output_pre_fix.cpp` 
and `output_post_fix.cpp` in the `data/different_between_pre_and_post` directory.

Example usage:
```python
perform_diff_on_files()
```

## `generate_html_diff() -> None`
This function generates an HTML file from a diff 
text file using the `diff2html` command. 
It takes the diff file generated by `perform_diff_on_files()` 
and creates an HTML representation.

Example usage:
```python
generate_html_diff()
```

## Summary
The `utils` directory contains utility functions 
that perform various tasks within the `ai_doxygen_cleaner` 
project. These tasks include compiling warning details 
into a list of prompts, comparing file differences, 
and generating HTML files from diff files. 
These utilities aid in the project's aim of cleaning and managing Doxygen warnings.
